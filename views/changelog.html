<ul>
  <li>blah</li>
</ul>
--> <h4>0.1.18 <span>2014/09/08</span></h4> <ul> <li>Some achievements are unmasked as you get closer to completing them.</li> <li>Fixed achievement link color.</li> <li>Masked achievements ("???") can now be shown/hidden.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.17 <span>2014/09/07</span></h4> <ul> <li>Achievements!</li> <li>Added some missing unit descriptions.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.16 <span>2014/09/05</span></h4> <ul> <li>Changelog link moved next to the other links.

If you're trying to save up lots of larvae, encase them in cocoons for safekeeping so you don't accidentally spend them. Cocoons should let you use the "buy max" button without fear.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.14 <span>2014/09/04</span></h4> <ul> <li>The game's non-https address should now load properly in Firefox.</li> <li>The options screen lets you opt out of Google Analytics.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.13 <span>2014/09/04</span></h4> <ul> <li>You can now specify a much higher number of units to buy at once - it doesn't max out at 1 sextillion anymore.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.12 <span>2014/09/04</span></h4> <ul> <li>Invisible backend changes, nothing to see here.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.11 <span>2014/09/03</span></h4> <ul> <li>Upgrade costs should have more consistent order.</li> <li>Nicer, more consistent number formatting.</li> <li>The page refreshes automatically when a newer version of the game is detected.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.10 <span>2014/09/02</span></h4> <ul> <li>Inject Larvae works again. Oops.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.9 <span>2014/09/01</span></h4> <ul> <li>When buying multiple units, their total cost is shown instead of the cost for a single unit.</li> <li>The cost of the maximum number of units you can afford can now be shown as a percentage. This is off by default, visit the options menu to enable it.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.8 <span>2014/09/01</span></h4> <ul> <li>Buy-exactly-n is back by popular demand.</li> <li>Units-bought counts include twins again.

(High-tier units assume you already know better.)</li> <li>Selecting a unit now shows how fast it's being produced. Statistics page has this too.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.3 <span>2014/08/29</span></h4> <ul> <li>Giant Arachnomorphs have a valid price.</li> <li>Any save state with a broken (NaN) value should have it automatically reset to 0.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.2 <span>2014/08/29</span></h4> <ul> <li>Number formatting improved for numbers below 999 decillion.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.1 <span>2014/08/28</span></h4> <ul> <li>Column buy/buy-max buttons work.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.0 <span>2014/08/28</span></h4> <ul> <li>Initial public testing release.
