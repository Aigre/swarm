</ul>
--> <h4>0.1.7 <span>2014/08/31</span></h4> <ul> <li>You can now buy multiple upgrades with one click.</li> <li>There are now three buttons for buying units: buy 1, buy 25%, buy max. Buy-exactly-n is gone; it was awkward to use anyway.</li> <li>Removed the buy/select mode from the top. It wasn't widely used, and was confusing if accidentally changed.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.6 <span>2014/08/31</span></h4> <ul> <li>More invisible backend changes, nothing to see here.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.5 <span>2014/08/31</span></h4> <ul> <li>Unit list is better behaved with long unit names and text selection.</li> <li>Some invisible backend changes.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.4 <span>2014/08/29</span></h4> <ul> <li>Mid-tier meat-producing units now warn players who want to start their next tier very early. (High-tier units assume you already know better.)</li> <li>Selecting a unit now shows how fast it's being produced. Statistics page has this too.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.3 <span>2014/08/29</span></h4> <ul> <li>Giant Arachnomorphs have a valid price.</li> <li>Any save state with a broken (NaN) value should have it automatically reset to 0.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.2 <span>2014/08/29</span></h4> <ul> <li>Number formatting improved for numbers below 999 decillion.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.1 <span>2014/08/28</span></h4> <ul> <li>Column buy/buy-max buttons work.</li> </ul> <h4>0.1.0 <span>2014/08/28</span></h4> <ul> <li>Initial public testing release. Here be dragons.</li> </ul> </div>
