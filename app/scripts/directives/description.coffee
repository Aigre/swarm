 # @ngdoc directive

 # Use either static descriptions from the spreadsheet, or templated descriptions in /app/views/desc.
 # Spreadsheet descriptions of '' or '-' indicate that we should try to use a template.
 # (We used to do stupid $compile tricks to allow templating in the spreadsheet, but that caused memory leaks. #177)
